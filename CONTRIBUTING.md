## Styling

- Use `###` headers for your sections.
- Also use `###` for categories (these should group together relevant sections) and `####` for subcategories.
- Add a link to your section/category to the contents section (use relative links).
- Make sure to include examples wherever possible (preferably GIFs).
- For command-line examples, wrap your commands in a `bash` code block. Ask [@rafalchmiel](https://github.com/rafalchmiel) or [@tiimgreen](https://github.com/tiimgreen) to take a screenshot (so that it is consistent with the rest) of the output if it has color, etc.
- At the end of your section, add a `Read more about...` link. This should directly link to [Git's](http://git-scm.com/docs) or [GitHub's](https://help.github.com/) documentation.
